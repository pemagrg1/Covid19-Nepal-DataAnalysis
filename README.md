# Covid19-Nepal-DataAnalysis
Analyzing Nepal's Covid19 data. Recently especially this month(May), the number of Covid Patients were increasing drastically. So thought why not do some analysis? 
<br><br><br>
Data Folder contains the data extraction code and the .csv files.
<br> Refference for Nepal_covid_district.py for scraping the data from:"https://coronanepal.live/" is https://www.kaggle.com/milan400/nepal-coronavirus-real-time-data-analysis. You can also check his Analysis which is pretty cool :)
<br><br>
 <b>PS:</b> Made a simple Analysis of the data. Hoping to learn more and do some awesome Analysis ^^
